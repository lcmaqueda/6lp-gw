Implementation of a Contiki-based 6LoWPAN-ND Proxy-Gateway for an embedded platform. The code acts as intermediary between ND for IPv6 (RFC4861) and 6LoWPAN-ND (Neighbor Discovery Optimization for Low Power and Lossy Networks, draft-ietf-6lowpan-nd-18). Besides, it performs packet forwarding between Ethernet and IEEE 802.15.4 Link-layers. The embedded platform comprises a MSP430F5435, a CC2520 RF transceiver and a ENC28J60 Ethernet controller.
